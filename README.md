# Docker images for Verified Organizations Network components

In support of VON a set of Docker images are published for running Hyperledger Indy components. The image repository is located [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgovimages/von-image/).

The images variously include:

- [Hyperledger Indy SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) and Indy CLI
- [Hyperledger Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

These images help to support the following projects:

- [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network)
- [The OrgBook](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook)
- [Aries CloudAgent Python (ACA-Py)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)
- [GreenLight](https://github.com/bcgov/greenlight)
- [VON Agent Template](https://github.com/bcgov/von-agent-template)
- [von-x](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-x)

## Indy SDK 1.8 images (out-dated)

The following images have `py35-` variants for Indy Node containers such as `von-network`, as well as `py36-` images for more common usage. Each image includes both Indy SDK and Indy Node.

| Image tag       | indy-sdk version           | indy-node version       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1.8-4           | 1.8.3                      | 1.7.0.dev902            |

| 1.8-2           | 1.8.2                      | dev-1.6.876             |

## Historical images

Images with `-ew-` included in the version tag include the `postgres_storage` Enterprise Wallet storage plugin for `indy-sdk`. Also included are the following Python libraries:

- [von-anchor](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von_anchor)
- [von-x](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-x)
- [didauth](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/didauth)

### OpenShift compatibility

Starting with `1.8-4` all images are compatible with OpenShift.  Prior to `1.8-4` only the `s2i` images were compatible with OpenShift, including configuration for building and deploying on OpenShift using the source-to-image builds.

### Two Python versions:

The `py35-*` images are intended for running `indy-node` containers such as `von-network`. For other usage `py36-*` is recommended.

# Rocket.Chat Notifications from your Docker Hub repository:

Refer to [Incoming WebHook Scripting](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/integrations/) for information on how to setup an incoming WebHook in Rocket.Chat.

Use [rocket.chat.integration.js](./scripts/rocket.chat.integration.js) for the **Script** associated with the WebHook integration.

On the WebHook tab of your Docker Hub repository, add a new WebHook and use the generated **WebHook URL** from the Rocket.Chat integration.

The payload of the Docker WebHook is not well documented, a recent (2019.04.08) sample can be found here; [DockerHubWebhookPayloadExample.json](./scripts/DockerHubWebhookPayloadExample.json).

To get a more up to date sample you can use [rocket.chat.capturepayload.js](./scripts/rocket.chat.capturepayload.js) as the script for the Rocket.Chat integration.  This will print out the json blob POSTed by the WebHook.
